This project uses texture packing to make loading more efficient.

Use the LibGDX texture packer GUI tool: https://github.com/crashinvaders/gdx-texture-packer-gui

This tool generates a texture atlas (you do not need to edit this manually)

When the textures are in a packed png, the originals are no longer needed. However I have kept them in the 
project files just in case you need to repack them.

There is a GDX Texture Packer project file that you can open in the assets file (called texturePackProject.tpproj)
to edit the texture pack
